Project: Howzatt! Cricket Scorekeeper

This project, Howzatt! Cricket Scorekeeper, is a website-based scoring system. The goal was to develop an interactive platform that can simulate and track a two-over or multi-over cricket match, as per user choice.

Users can input team names, start a match, and record every ball â€” runs, wickets, extras, and all. The app displays live updates and maintains a full scorecard.

The project includes multiple webpages:

setup.html

live.html

scorecard.html

summary.html

It also uses CSS files for styling:

setup.css

live.css

scorecard.css

summary.css

All match logic is handled in a single JavaScript file:

score.js

The app also uses localStorage to store match progress and enable persistent data across pages.
